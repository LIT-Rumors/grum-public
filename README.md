# GRuM: A Flexible Model-Driven Runtime Monitoring Framework and its Application to Automated Aerial and Ground Vehicles



Runtime monitoring is critical for ensuring safe operation and for enabling self-adaptive behavior of Cyber-Physical Systems. Monitors are established by identifying runtime properties of interest, creating Probes to instrument the system, and defining constraints to be checked at runtime.

GRuM is a  framework that combines model-driven techniques and runtime monitoring to automatically generate a customized monitoring platform for a given System under Monitoring. Relevant properties are captured in a Domain Model Fragment, and changes to the System under Monitoring can be easily accommodated by automatically regenerating the platform code.
